Query Question:-
Your task is to write an SQL query to retrieve a list of unique cities where patients in the patients table reside. The catch is, you only need to list cities that start with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U), and sort them in ascending order.

Concepts
To accomplish this task, you'll likely need to be familiar with the following SQL concepts:

SELECT: To specify the columns that should be returned in the result set.
DISTINCT: To ensure that the result set contains unique records.
WHERE: To filter the records based on specific conditions.
LIKE: To search for a specified pattern in a column.
ORDER BY: To sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
Now go ahead, write your SQL query. Good luck!

Query:-
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM patients
WHERE city LIKE 'A%' OR city LIKE 'E%' OR city LIKE 'I%' OR city LIKE 'O%' OR city LIKE 'U%'
ORDER BY city;
