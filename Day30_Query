Query Question:-
Your task is to write SQL queries to solve a series of challenges based on the chinook database. While constructing your queries, make sure to keep the following points in mind:

Stick to the table and column names exactly as defined in the chinook database schema. Deviations from the original names may result in incorrect results.

Use double quotes around table and column names for clarity, like "TableName".

When creating your solution, ensure the ORDER BY clause is used wherever applicable to avoid potential output mismatches.

Ensure your output column names match exactly with what's mentioned in the challenge description.

Database Schema

Tables to Use:

Invoice
InvoiceLine
Instructions:

Join the Invoice and InvoiceLine tables using the appropriate key.
Group the results by Invoice.InvoiceId.
Count the number of line items for each invoice. The result should have a column named LineCount that represents this count.
Display the Invoice.InvoiceId and LineCount.
Order your results by Invoice.InvoiceId.
Expected Output Columns:

Invoice.InvoiceId
LineCount

Query:-
SELECT
    Invoice."InvoiceId",
    COUNT(InvoiceLine."InvoiceLineId") AS LineCount
FROM
    Invoice
JOIN
    InvoiceLine ON Invoice."InvoiceId" = InvoiceLine."InvoiceId"
GROUP BY
    Invoice."InvoiceId"
ORDER BY
    Invoice."InvoiceId";
