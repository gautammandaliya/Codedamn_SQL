Query Question:-
Your goal is to retrieve specific information about patients based on certain criteria. Specifically, you are tasked with the following:
--> Retrieve the first_name, last_name, and height of the patient with the greatest height from the patients table

Schema
Schema of the patients table for reference
--> patient_id
--> first_name
--> last_name
--> gender
--> birth_date
--> city
--> province_id
--> allergies
--> height
-->weight

Concepts:
--> SELECT Statement: Used to select data from a database. The result is then stored in a result table.
--> Aggregate Functions: SQL aggregate functions return a single value, calculated from values in a column. The function MAX() is one such function which returns the maximum value of the selected column.

Query:-
SELECT first_name, last_name, height
FROM patients
ORDER BY height DESC
Limit 1;
