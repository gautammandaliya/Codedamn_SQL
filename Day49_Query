Welcome to the SQL practice lab, where you will hone your SQL skills using SQLite and the Chinook dataset. Follow the challenge instructions carefully to complete the lab successfully.

Setup
You don't need to worry about setting up your environment; everything has been pre-configured for you. Your task is to read the challenges and write SQL queries that solve them. Place your queries in the /home/damner/code/query.sql file.

Challenges
Your task is to pivot the "Title" column from the Employee table and count the number of occurrences of each unique title.

SalesAgentCount: Count of employees with the title 'Sales Support Agent'
SupportAgentCount: Count of employees with the title 'Support Representative'
OtherTitleCount: Count of employees with titles not in ('Sales Support Agent', 'Support Representative')
Order By: Your output should be sorted by SalesAgentCount.

SELECT
    COUNT(CASE WHEN "Title" = 'Sales Support Agent' THEN 1 END) AS "SalesAgentCount",
    COUNT(CASE WHEN "Title" = 'Support Representative' THEN 1 END) AS "SupportAgentCount",
    COUNT(CASE WHEN "Title" NOT IN ('Sales Support Agent', 'Support Representative') THEN 1 END) AS "OtherTitleCount"
