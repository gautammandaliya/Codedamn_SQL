Query Question:-
Your challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:
--> Retrieve the first_name and last_name of patients table.
--> The query should only select patients whose weight is within the range of 100 to 120 (inclusive).

Table Schema
You have to make use of the patients table. Here is the complete schema of the table for your reference
--> patient_id
--> first_name
--> last_name
--> gender
--> birth_date
--> city
--> province_id
--> allergies
--> height
--> weight

Key Concepts
--> SQLite: A C-language library that provides a lightweight disk-based database. It doesnâ€™t require a separate server process.
--> SQL SELECT Statement: Used to select data from a database and fetch the result table. The result can be stored in a table or used as it is.
--> SQL WHERE Clause: Used to filter the results and extract only the necessary records.
--> BETWEEN Operator: In SQL, the BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set based on a range. It can be used with numbers, text and even dates.
Remember, it's essential to practice and test your queries to ensure accuracy. Good luck!

Query:-
SELECT FIRST_NAME,
LAST_NAME
FROM PATIENTS
WHERE WEIGHT BETWEEN 100 AND 120;
