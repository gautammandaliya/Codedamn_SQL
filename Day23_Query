Query Question:-
You will be working on challenges that involve multiple tables from the Chinook database, such as Customer, Invoice, and more.

Database Schema
You can find the full schema of the database in your lab resources. However, for a quick reference, you'll be primarily working with the following tables:

Customer
Invoice
Challenge
Objective:

Your task is to identify customers from the Customer table who have never made a purchase. This means they do not have any corresponding records in the Invoice table.

Tables Involved:

Customer

Invoice

Sorting Criteria:

Your query should order the results by Customer.CustomerId.

Output Columns:

Your query should return the following columns explicitly named:

Customer.FirstName

Customer.LastName

Note:

You should use a LEFT JOIN between Customer and Invoice tables to achieve this. Make sure to handle cases where there may be no matching records in the Invoice table for a Customer. Your query should explicitly mention all column names and tables involved.

Query:-
SELECT
    "Customer"."FirstName",
    "Customer"."LastName"
FROM
    "Customer"
LEFT JOIN
    "Invoice" ON "Customer"."CustomerId" = "Invoice"."CustomerId"
WHERE
    "Invoice"."InvoiceId" IS NULL
ORDER BY
    "Customer"."CustomerId";
