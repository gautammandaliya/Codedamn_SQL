Query Question:-
The database contains multiple tables, but for this lab, you'll primarily focus on two tables:

patients
province_names
Exercise
Write a SQL query to show the first name, last name, and the full province name of each patient. The objective is to replace any abbreviated province codes with their complete names. For example, the province name should appear as 'Ontario' instead of 'ON'.

Important Concepts
To complete this lab, you'll need a good grasp of:

Basic SQL SELECT statements for data retrieval
SQL JOIN operations to combine rows from two or more tables
Good luck!

Query:-
SELECT
    patients.first_name,
    patients.last_name,
    province_names.province_name AS province_name
FROM
    patients
JOIN
    province_names ON patients.province_id = province_names.province_id;
