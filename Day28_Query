Query Question:-
Welcome to this SQL lab where you'll be working with the Chinook database to solve various challenges. This lab is designed to test your SQL skills, particularly in SQLite.

Database Schema
Here's a reminder of some of the tables you'll be working with:

Artist: Contains ArtistId and Name.
Album: Contains AlbumId, Title, and ArtistId.
Track: Contains TrackId, Name, AlbumId, and other attributes.
Genre: Contains GenreId and Name.
For the full schema, please refer to the document provided.

Challenges
Objective: Your task is to write a SQL query to identify tracks that appear under more than one genre.

Important: Your output will be compared with the expected output; therefore, please ensure to include all the specified columns, tables and ordering criteria.

Tables Involved: Utilize the Track and Genre tables.

Final Columns: The output should consist of two columns:

Name from the Track table
GenreCount, which is a count of how many genres are associated with each track.
Ordering: The output should be ordered by TrackId.

Hints:

You may need to use JOIN operations between the Track and Genre tables.
Aggregate functions can help in counting the number of genres for each track.
Consider using a GROUP BY clause to aggregate data based on TrackId.
A HAVING clause might be useful to filter tracks appearing in more than one genre.

Query:-
SELECT
    t.Name AS TrackName,
    COUNT(DISTINCT g.GenreId) AS GenreCount
FROM
    Track t
JOIN
    Genre g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
GROUP BY
    t.TrackId, t.Name
HAVING
    GenreCount > 1
ORDER BY
    t.TrackId;
