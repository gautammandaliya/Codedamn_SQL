Query Question:-
In this lab, you will be working with a database containing a table called admissions. Your task is to calculate the total cost of admissions for patients based on their insurance status.

Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance and $10 for patients with insurance. You can determine if a patient has insurance based on their patient_id; all patients with an even patient_id have insurance.

You are required to write a SQL query that does two things:

Label each patient with 'Yes' if they have insurance and 'No' if they don't.
Calculate the total admission cost for each group ('Yes' and 'No').
Concepts Required
Conditional Logic: Use of the CASE statement to apply conditions.
Aggregation: Using SUM to calculate total costs.
Grouping Records: Usage of GROUP BY to segregate data into groups.
Your output should include two columns: one that states if the patient has insurance ('Yes' or 'No') and another that gives the total admission cost for that group.

Query:-
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS has_insurance,
    SUM(CASE
            WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 10  -- Insurance cost
            ELSE 50  -- No insurance cost
        END) AS cost_after_insurance
FROM
    admissions
GROUP BY
    has_insurance;
