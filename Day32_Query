Challenge: Show the category name and the average product unit price for each category, rounding the result to two decimal places. The column names must be category_name, average_unit_price and ordered by average_unit_price in descending order

Important Concepts:

JOIN: Understand how to use the JOIN clause to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
GROUP BY: Grasp the concept of grouping rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
Aggregate Functions: Familiarize yourself with SQL aggregate functions, like AVG, to compute a single result value from a set of input values.
